Bullet points:
    - Social Contract v.1 has been done.
    - Learned about SCRUM.
    - Got a first impression of the course.
    - Sprints, Product backlog

Since this is the first individual reflection I think there's actually not a lot to reflect about
But overall I think I will use this reflection to test out a good blueprint for my other individual reflections.

* What I/we achieved this week:
This week we mainly started up the project by having our first team meeting. Since I've done several group projects with the majority of the group members before I feel like I don't have to worry about how much effort the other members put in.

During the meeting we managed to otherwise come up to some agreements for the Code of Conduct (Social Contract). Since I was the secretary and wrote all of the notes down I think that I didn't really account for many of the agreements but instead I chipped in with some tweaks here and there. Otherwise we didn't actually manage more than that, we had one or two projects ideas but they were very loosely discussed and this will probably be the bullet point for next meeting on monday.

We also set up our GIT, Trello, Team communication (FB Messenger) and joined our group on CANVAS.

* What could have been done better:
So this week due to not having started up with the project and actually not having any "goals" of the week I don't think there was anything that could have been done better. Maybe we could have found out what we wanted to do on our group project(?) but that's hard to achieve since we all had to start up the other course for this term.

For me personally maybe attend more lectures and exercises. This week I had other obligations that sadly had more prio than these lectures but next week I hope I will do better.

* Do I want to learn/understand something more?
I definitely want to learn more about the agile working method. I have stumbled across it before but never actually worked with it myself in a group project. The thought of having sprints, goals, product backlog, and an overall better understanding of how the project is going is only positive.

* How can I help someone on the team to learn something new?
N/A due to us not having started anything yet.

* What was my contribution to the team's application of scrum?
- Secretary during the team meeting for the Social Contract.

* What was my contribution to the team's deliveries?
N/A due to us not having started anything yet.

*Things to do for next week:
- Set-up the project.
    - Find out what we want to do.
    - Get an understanding of the high-level concept of the project (how it should work, what is a must have and so on).
- Do the presentation of the project on Wednesday.
- Make sure that everyone knows what they have to do for the weeks sprint.
