# Routemeister
With a frontend built in HTML with Bootstrap and JavaScript as well as ThymeLeaf, and a backend built on Java with the Spring framwork for interfacing with it, this application can be hosted locally or deployed to be used as a route generator. The application was developed by a group at Chalmers Univeristy of Technology as part of the course DAT257.

## Install and launch

To host the application locally you need to have Maven installed and JVM. The application is written to work in JVM version 17 but can still work in older versions. When these prerequisites are checked you can clone the repo and start using the application.
