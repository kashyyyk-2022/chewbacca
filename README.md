# Routemeister
With a frontend built in HTML with Bootstrap and JavaScript as well as ThymeLeaf, and a backend built on Java with the Spring framwork for interfacing with it, this application can be hosted locally or deployed to be used as a route generator. The application was developed by a group at Chalmers Univeristy of Technology as part of the course DAT257.
