Code of Conduct - Kashyyyk

* You have to attend the booked group meetings – if, for some reason, You are not able to attend give a heads up in a timely manner.

* The group should as far as possible have at least ONE meeting per week – preferably on afternoons.

* Follow the Scrum Master Schema – See note 1.

* Scrum Master tasks are:
    - Keep track of the backlog.
    - Add tasks into Trello.

* You execute the task You have taken (or been appointed to) with as good quality as possible. Ask for help when you need it.

* If someone asks for help – Everyone in the group have a responsibility to help the Asker.

* Communicate with the group about what You are currently working with to avoid having two members doing the same job.
    - If You don’t have anything to do – Check the Trello for unassigned tasks to do. Alternatively bring it up during the weekly group meetings.

* Keep the Trello updated:
    - You assign your own name to the task in Trello.

* You take full responsibility for your own task.

* When a conflict occurs:
    - Discuss and resonate about both parties opinions and listen to each other. Let both parties talk without getting interrupted.
    - If both parties can NOT reach a decision – The group will do a vote about which direction the project should take.

* Every meeting commences with a “around the table” where every member in the group gets their own time slot to speak and express their own opinion without getting interrupted.

* Before ending a meeting the group will plan time and place for the next meeting.

* You should follow the GIT protocol when doing any actions with GIT e.g.
    - Add a proper comment when doing a Pull Request, include which members that needs to look at the request (meaning which members that is going to be affected by the request).
    
* Every week one of the group members will act as PO. The list is in the scrummaster_po_schedule.txt file.

* The PO will act as a judge when new functions are added. The PO checks if DoD is checked and  manages what User Stories should be made. 
  The PO is the one putting User Stories from the "backlog" to "next sprint" in Trello. The PO will also make a rundown och the backlog after a roundtable meeting


* Further agreements can be added during the project.
